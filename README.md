##  A Window into the R Packages mentioned at the R New-York Conference 

I attended the R New York Conference https://www.rstats.nyc on May 10 and May 11, 2019, which was packed with a number of wonderful presentations. Many of the speakers were kind enough to share the R packages they used in the work they presented. Some were familiar but many of them were new to me. Here is a short summary of the different R packages. The *Use Cases* here correspond to the examples used by the speakers.
