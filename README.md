##  A Window into the R Packages mentioned at the R New-York Conference 

I attended the R New York Conference https://www.rstats.nyc on May 10 and May 11, 2019. Many of the speakers were kind enough to share the R packages they used in the work they presented. Some were familiar to me but many of them were new to me. Here is a short summary of the different R packages. 


1.	**tidyverse:** collection of R packages designed for datascience
   * https://www.tidyverse.org
   * Speaker: Ludmilla Janda, Amplify
   * *Use case: Building Tidyverse from Scratch Using Scratch Box to teach Data Visualization to middle school students. Different blocks are created for each of the tidyverse components. The blocks can be chained together to complete the tasks. Students are able to do data processing and build complex visualizations by interacting only with the blocks.*
2. **h20:** open source machine learning platform for parallelized implementations of supervised and unsupervised algorithms
   * https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/h2o/h2o.pdf 
   * Speaker: Emily Dodwell, AT&T Labs Research
   * *Use Case: Building recommendation systems for DirectTV using tangled Lasso and Boosted trees
3. **sparklyr:** R interface to Apache Spark*
   * https://spark.rstudio.com 
   * Speaker: Emily Dodwell, AT&T Labs Research
   * *Use Case: Building recommendation systems for DirectTV using tangled Lasso and Boosted trees*
4. **usethis:** A workflow package for creating R packages
   * https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/02/usethis-1-3-0/ 
   * Resources: https://happygitwithr.com, https://r-pks.org
   * Speaker: Emily Robinson, DataCamp
   * *Use Case: Building R packages*
5. **drake:**  pipeline toolkit for building reproducible and replicable projects
   * https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/index.html
   * Resource: https://github.com/aedobbyn/nyc-fires
   * Speaker: Amanda Dobbyn, Earlybird Software
   * *Use Case: Workflow for analysing when and where fires happen in NYC*
